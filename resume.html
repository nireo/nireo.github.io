        <ul>
          
            <li>Working on back-end software using Go. I mainly created new features from user stories and fixed bugs and provided technical support by calling GRPC routes directly and editing the PostgreSQL database.</li>
          
            <li>Also worked on the front-end by writing the implementations for new features using React.</li>
          
            <li>Worked on setting up new microservices with CI/CD pipelines and Terraform.</li>
            <li>Planned and created an email reminder functionality which contributed to tens of thousands of people remembering to accept their benefits.</li>

        <hr>
        <p class="time-frame">A distributed time-series database built entirely from scratch with very few dependencies. Both the internal engine and the distribution is self-written. The code also contains a lot of tests, stress testing utilities and space analyzation utilities.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class="time-frame">A distributed filesystem built in C. The iso executable itself takes care of distributing data to different NGINX volume servers. The distribution is based on hashing the file's path is hashed an the hashing strategy equally divides load to different nodes with a configurable replication factor.</p>

        </a>
        <hr>
        <p class="time-frame">A proof of concept SQL database built on top of LevelDB. The project contains a SQL parser that is then converted to a internal AST. The AST is then parsed and parameters from the query are extracted. The rows of the database are encoded into a form in which they can be easily iterated using LevelDB. This approach was inspired by CockroachDBs row encoding.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class="time-frame">A small lisp-like programming language that is compiled straight to x64 executables. The code is first parsed into SExpressions which are then used to generate a intermediate representation (IR) of the code. Optimizations are performed on this IR which is then encoded into a ELF executable.</p>

        <p class="time-frame">A gossip protocol based eventually consistent in-memory key-value store written in Go. The code contains an embeddable interface to interact with nodes. The only dependency for the code is the Go standard library.</p>
