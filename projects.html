<p>A collection of systems programming projects built for learning and experimentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/haystack">haystack</a>: a distributed file system inspired by Facebook's Haystack architecture. Features a Raft-based directory cluster for high availability, mapping files to logical volumes stored as large append-only files. The directory coordinates client read/write operations without directly handling file storage, while replication ensures data durability across multiple store servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/mc">mc</a>: a complete C compiler written in Go, featuring lexical analysis, parsing, intermediate representation generation, and x64 assembly code generation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/simdcsv">simdcsv</a>: a fast C++ CSV parser utilizing simd instructions to speed up indexing a CSV file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/mci">mci</a>: a proof-of-concept distributed CI/CD pipeline service with web interface. An orchestrator distributes work to agents that execute YAML-defined pipelines within Docker containers like Alpine Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/serie">serie</a>: an embeddable time series database with a custom LSM tree optimized for time series queries. Uses delta-delta encoding for memory efficiency and includes HTTP API, consistent hashing for distribution, and a custom query language parser for data aggregation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/dcache">dcache</a>: a high-performance distributed in-memory cache built with Go. Uses gRPC for inter-node communication, Serf for cluster management, and Raft for distributed consensus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/distsql">distsql</a>: a distributed SQLite3 database with HTTP API and gRPC communication between nodes. Implements Raft consensus for data consistency across the cluster.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/rc">rc</a>: a Lisp compiler written in Rust that generates standalone ELF binaries. Parses S-expressions, generates intermediate representation with optimizations like constant folding, and compiles directly to x64 machine code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/levelsql">levelsql</a>: a minimal SQL implementation built on top of LevelDB. Encodes relational data structures as key-value pairs, demonstrating how SQL can be layered over NoSQL storage engines.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/sagasu">sagasu</a>: a lightweight service discovery tool featuring a clustered service registry. Provides basic functionality similar to HashiCorp Consul for microservice environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/upfi">upfi</a>: a minimalist file hosting platform focusing on simplicity and ease of deployment.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/gocry">gocry</a>: a proof-of-concept ransomware implementation for educational and security research purposes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/karu">karu</a>: a Bitcask-style key-value store for Linux written in C++. Built to explore large-scale C++ development patterns and persistent storage optimization.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/stupidhttp">stupidhttp</a>: a HTTP server built from scratch in Go without using net/http. Implements a subset of HTTP/1.1 with HTTPS support, demonstrating protocol implementation fundamentals.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/sch">sch</a>: a fast, lightweight chat application built with Rust and Tokio, showcasing asynchronous programming and real-time communication.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/hashvis">hashvis</a>: a utility that generates unique ASCII art visualizations from file contents. Creates deterministic visual fingerprints by hashing file content to seed a random walk pattern on a grid, rendered as ASCII characters.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nireo/chibi">chibi</a>: a distributed SQL database implemented using only Go's standard library. Demonstrates fundamental database concepts without external dependencies.</li>
</ul>
