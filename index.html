    <h2>interests and projects</h2>
    <p>
      Previously I did a lot of web development, but nowadays I'm more
      interested in building distributed systems and writing systems
      applications. Some projects I'm really happy about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/dcache"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >dcache</a
        >: a fast distributed in-memory cache built in go.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/distsql"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >distsql</a
        >: a distributed SQLite3 database built in go.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/rc"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >rc</a
        >: a lisp to native executable compiler written in rust
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/upfi"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >upfi</a
        >: a file hosting web app built without javascript in go
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/gocry"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >gocry</a
        >: a proof of concept ransomware built in go
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/iso"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >iso</a
        >: a distributed filesystem written in C
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/nireo/karu"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >karu</a
        >: a bitcask style c++ key-value store for linux
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Almost all of the projects I've worked on are hosted on my
      <a
        href="https://github.com/nireo"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        >github</a
      >. Most of the projects are finished if they haven't seen a commit in
      ages, but some projects are also abandoned due to loss of interest.
