<p>Hello, I'm currently a computer science student completing my bachelors degree and I also work as a back-end Go developer and a teaching assistant on a programming course. I'm interested in many different areas of science and technology as well as other subjects such as philosophy and literature. Here are some of my current interests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed systems:</strong> distributed consensus, communication and scalability of large systems.</li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-peer:</strong> P2P algorithms, distributed hash tables, mesh networks and freedom of information.</li>
<li><strong>Compilers:</strong> Parsing, strong type systems, functional programming languages, optimization and code generation.</li>
<li><strong>Code editors:</strong> Highly configurable editors such as Emacs or neovim.</li>
<li><strong>Split ergonomic keyboards:</strong> Layouts for 30% keyboards, different designs and the whole building process.</li>
<li><strong>Classic literature:</strong> existence of God, existentialism, Russian classics, mostly older books.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy programming in Rust and Go currently and mainly work on learning projects that replicate larger software projects such as <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a> and implementing algorithms from scientific papers related to distributed systems, P2P and cryptography. I'm currently running Arch Linux with Hyprland and using neovim as my editor. I also have a 36 key split keyboard which I designed a custom <a href="https://github.com/nireo/layout">layout</a> for.</p>
