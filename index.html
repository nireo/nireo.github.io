<p>Hello, I'm currently a computer science student completing my bachelors degree and I also work as a back-end Go developer and a teaching assistant on a programming course. I'm interested in many different areas of science and technology as well as other subjects such as philosophy and literature. Here are some of my current interests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted messaging and post quantum cryptography.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed systems:</strong> distributed consensus, communication and scalability of large systems.</li>
<li><strong>Compilers:</strong> Parsing, strong type systems, functional programming languages, optimization and code generation.</li>
<li><strong>Code editors:</strong> Highly configurable editors such as vim or emacs.</li>
<li><strong>Split ergonomic keyboards:</strong> Layouts for 30% keyboards, different designs and the whole building process. I have two sub 40 key keyboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy working on toy projects in my free time mostly focusing on rebuilding existing software to learn from it as well as implementing algorithms and concepts from my areas of interest. For example, I've implemented X3DH and the Double Ratchet algorithms used in end-to-end encrypted messaging, a C compiler and many other projects. I mostly enjoy programming in Go as I value simplicity.</p>
