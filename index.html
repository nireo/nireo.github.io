      <p>
        Working with Go at my job. Mainly interested in big data systems,
        compilers, distributed systems, computer graphics and linux. Currently
        enjoy programming in Go, C and Rust.

    <p>Some miscellaneous projects that I've done just for fun.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>

          href="https://github.com/nireo/chibi"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >chibi</a

          href="https://github.com/nireo/haystack"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
          >haystack</a
        >: a distributed file system with an architecture similar to Facebook's Haystack. This entails a directory that is in this case a Raft cluster for added availability and reliability. The directory maps files to logical volumes which are large append-only files on disk that contain many smaller files. Clients ask the directory where to write files and where to read them, meaning the directory doesn't directly interact with stores. Replication is done using the idea that a single logical volume exists in many store servers and a single file is mapped to a single logical volume meaning a copy of the file is on N store servers.

          >rc</a
        >: a lisp compiler written in Rust that compiles code directly into ELF binaries without any dependencies. It parses s-expressions and generates an IR. Small optimizations like constant folding are done and then the IR is translated into x64 ELF binaries.

        >: a utility that generates a unique ASCII art visualization from the contents of a given file. It reads the input file, hashes its content to seed a random number generator, and then uses this generator to create a "random walk" pattern on a grid. This pattern is then rendered as ASCII characters to the console, providing a visual fingerprint of the file.
