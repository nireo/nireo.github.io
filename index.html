                <p>I'm currently a computer science student completing my bachelors degree and I work as a back-end Go developer. I'm interested in many different areas of science and technology as well as other subjects such as philosophy and literature.</p>
<p>Currently focusing on cryptography, distributed systems, system architecture, peer-to-peer and decentralization. I also find note-taking systems, ergonomic keyboards, and customizable editors such as neovim and Emacs intriguing. For programming languages, I currently most enjoy Rust, Zig, Go, and Lean.</p>
