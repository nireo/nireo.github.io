<p>I recently bought a chocofi which is a 36-key split keyboard. Thus far I've been loving it. At first the column-staggered keys proved difficult to accurately type on, but after a little bit a practice my typing has finally gotten faster. This is also my first time using choc switches and they're mostly great other than it being easier to press the wrong keys.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Before the keyboard was delivered I did some investigation about different types of layouts and mainly miryoku caught my eye. However, the delay of pressing the asdf and jlk; keys was too annoying to continue using it. After that experiment I decided to go with callum mods (I don't know the official name for them). The benefit of this layout is that there are no delays, but this comes with the downside of having a clunkier modifer keys. The layout I came up with is <a href="https://github.com/nireo/layout">here</a>, but I will continue to use it after I get more comfortable with the board.</p>
