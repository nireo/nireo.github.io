<p>After using the 36 key chocofi keyboard for a while, I decided I wanted to actually build one of these keyboards myself. I mainly noticed that I wasn't usign the two thumb keys on the thumb cluster meaning that I was basically just using a 34 key keyboard. This made the decision to go down to 34 keys easier.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-board">building the board</h2>
<p>I noticed that my university had an electronics lab where I could use a soldering iron and an air vaccuum and other nice tooling. The build itself was fine except for the fact that I had burned one of the jumpers on the pcb. This meant that I had to cut a small piece of copper wire and solder it to the pcb to connect two points together without the jumper. However, with some help I was able to do this. Now I'm just afraid that the wire will break at some point, but I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">future plans</h2>
<p>Building the board was really fun and I most likely will be building some kind of split keyboard in the future. Maybe a dactyl or something like that. I think however, that I will be sticking to 34 keys as I don't really see the need for more keys as it keeps every single key at a comfortable distance from the homerow and I also found that the 2 extra thumb keys on the chocofi caused some weird thumb positions to reach them.</p>
