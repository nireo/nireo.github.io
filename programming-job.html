    <h1>first programming job</h1>
    <em>25-1-2023</em>
    <p>
      As of writing this I'm closing in on having worked professionally as a programmer for a month at a Finnish company. I'm not a consultant. I've been working on a product that I'm interested in which raises my work motivation. I've heard that it's more interesting to work on product rather than being a consultant but it's hard to say at this point. Anyway I've learned a lot in such a short time and I would like to share some of my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first time I've ever worked on a programming project with multiple people and it feels reassuring and weird at the same time. Knowing that someone might take care of something hard, but feels odd coming from a background of having to fix everything myself.
